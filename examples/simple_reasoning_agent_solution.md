  The key is to construct a question that accounts for both possibilities." }

  approach is to ask a question about what the other guard would say, using logical consistency to neutralize the lie." }

  { "reflection": "The correct strategy is to ask one guard: 'If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to treasure, which door would they point to?' Then,    
  choose the opposite door. This works because both the truth-teller and the liar will point to the dangerous door, so choosing the opposite ensures safety and leads to    
  treasure." }

  To guarantee choosing the treasure door, ask one guard the following question:  
  
  ▌ "If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to treasure, which door would they point to?"  
  
  Then, choose the opposite door.    
  
  Why this works:
  
   • If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you what the liar would say — and the liar would point to the danger door. So the truth-teller points to the    
danger door.
   • If you ask the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say — the truth-teller would point to the treasure door, but the liar will lie and say the   
other door (the danger door).   
  
  In both cases, the guard points to the danger door. So by choosing the opposite, you always pick the treasure door.
  
  ✅ This strategy works regardless of which guard you ask and which door they stand in front of.
  
  Final Answer: Ask: "If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to treasure, which door would they point to?" Then pick the opposite door.
