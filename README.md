We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for python project management. To get started, please follow the below steps:

1. clone the repo  
   `git clone https://github.com/Roudranil/lattice.git`
2. navigate to the repository
3. create the virtual environment (make sure you installed uv)  
   `uv venv`
4. activate the virtual environment using  
   `source .venv/bin/activate`
