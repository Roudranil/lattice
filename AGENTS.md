- write clean short maintainable code
- no meta commentary in code. you should not write comments as if **you** are writing it for **me**. It should be like **I** am writing for **myself**.
- comments should be like descriptive, all lower case, like a human has written for themselves.
- functions and classes should have google style docstrings
- functions should not have blank lines in them
- f-strings should be used for string formatting
- use type hints in classes and functions.
